----- ASSIGNMENT 2 ---- 
----- SUBMISSION TIME 2:45 AM ----- 

Initially worked with printf.c 
found that modifying the code and compiling each time takes a lot of time. Also debugging was not easier 

Used chmod.c to work - found it very confusing 

used echo.c to complete the assignment 

Things changed in code: 
1. Echo.c starts with the left most arguments moving towards the right most arguments of a given input 
2. Idea - use right most arguements first, then move towards the left most 
3. Thi prints the values in reverse,instead of printing in left-to-right order. 
4. Updated the output.txt file with new reversed output
5. Updated the echo.patch file to contact the changelist 
6. Updated the git repository with all these files

TO MAKE
1. use ./configure in the same directory *siva2 here*
2. use make to create object files in the same directory *siva2 here*
3. If object files are not found, no output comes or just regular echo output comes. 

GIT
1. Copy all files into the git local repository
2. Clone the git repository from the url 
3. make folder hw2, make 3 files, copy all contents in to the files. 
4. Add them to git 
5. Commit them
6. Push them
